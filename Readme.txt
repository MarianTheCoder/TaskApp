Task App with calendar, timer and note app

- I have build the app with MERN stack + tailwind css
- I learned to make Routes with react router, design fast with tailwind, how to create endpoints and take advantage of React for no need to reload the page.
- I created a login and register page where you create an account. You can not acces the page without it.
- i made my dynamic calendar which is accurate and can be used to program a task for later.
- Tasks are ordered based on date or priority.
- Everything can be deleted or edited including notes.


things i struggled with:
- managing the case scenarios with the task being edited.
- auto saving for the notes.
- making good use of the Routes and ContextAPI.

Steps to start:
- Start the Frontend with npm run dev
- Start the backend with nodemon server.js

- Create an account then login, add Tasks, add focus sessions or Notes. Enjoy;
